        <p>
          PhysioAqua was born when we realized that although Aquatic Therapy is wonderful and has visible benefits, but we found most of our patients discontinued once the temperature variates. Hygiene was another prominent issue in public pools. Last but not the least most of the pools were far away from the patient-friendly environment.
          <br />To solve these problems, we thought of building our own setup with:
          <ul>
            <li>Temperature Controlled Pool to avoid the discontinuity caused by seasonal temperature variations</li>
            <li>Patient-friendly environment</li>
            <li>Hospital grade hygiene</li>
          </ul>
